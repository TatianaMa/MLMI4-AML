#+TITLE: Things to do for the project

* Extensions for the project
** Bayesian Optimisation

** Investingating weight pruning
*** Split network idea maybe?
*** Sparse matrix multiplication
*** Investingating efficiency of pruned network: time/ energy/ memory
*** Turn the weight matrix into block-diagonal:
    paper:[[https://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/5486/rearrange-an-ordinary-matrix-to-block-diagonal-form][Turn a matrix into block-diagonal]] 

*** Prune weights and biases separately?
** Think about Beta-BBB

** Implement variational CNNs or RNNs

** Continual learning with BBB
